# Product: ClewdR

## 1. Problem Solved

ClewdR addresses the need for a high-performance, resource-efficient, and reliable proxy server for Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude and Gemini. Traditional script-based proxies (e.g., in Node.js or Python) often suffer from high memory consumption, slower startup times, and lower throughput, making them less suitable for production environments or resource-constrained devices.

ClewdR solves these problems by providing a production-grade solution that is:
- **Fast and Efficient**: Built in Rust, it offers significantly higher performance and lower memory usage compared to alternatives.
- **Reliable**: Designed with an enterprise-grade architecture to handle high request volumes with stability.
- **User-Friendly**: Features a full-fledged web UI for easy configuration and monitoring, removing the need for manual file editing.

## 2. Core User Personas

- **Developers & Hobbyists**: Individuals who need a reliable way to proxy requests to Claude or Gemini for their applications, bots, or experiments, often on personal machines or small servers.
- **Power Users**: Users of applications like SillyTavern or IDE extensions (VSCode, Cursor) who want to integrate LLM capabilities seamlessly and efficiently.
- **Small to Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs)**: Teams that require a stable, scalable, and easy-to-deploy proxy for integrating LLM services into their products without dedicating significant infrastructure resources.

## 3. Key Product Goals

- **Performance Leadership**: Deliver a 10x performance improvement over traditional script-based proxies.
- **Resource-Efficiency**: Maintain a minimal memory footprint (single-digit MBs) and fast startup times.
- **Production-Grade Reliability**: Ensure stability and high throughput for thousands of requests per second.
- **Ease of Use**: Provide a comprehensive Web UI for configuration, monitoring, and management, eliminating the need for command-line or file-based setup.
- **Universal Compatibility**: Offer a single, zero-dependency binary that runs across all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android) and is Docker-ready.
